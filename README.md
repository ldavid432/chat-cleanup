## Known Issues

When 'remove group iron broadcasts from clan chat' is enabled, and you are on the clan tab, and the chat is reloaded (via sending/receiving a message or otherwise),
then the scroll bar will jump slightly (though this *shouldn't* actually change your scroll positions) and,
if there are not enough chats to fill the full height of the chatbox, all the chats will jump slightly.
